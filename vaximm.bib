	abstract = {{VXM}01 is a first-in-kind orally applied tumor vaccine based on live attenuated Salmonella typhi carrying an expression plasmid encoding {VEGFR}2, an antigen expressed on tumor vasculature and a stable and accessible target for anti-angiogenic intervention. A recent randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I dose-escalation trial in advanced pancreatic cancer patients demonstrated safety, immunogenicity and transient, T-cell response-related anti-angiogenic activity of four priming vaccinations applied within one week. We here evaluated whether monthly boost vaccinations are safe and can sustain increased frequencies of vaccine-specific T cells. Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:1 to priming with {VXM}01 followed by up to six monthly boost vaccinations, or placebo treatment. Vaccinations were applied orally at two alternative doses of either 106 colony-forming units ({CFU}) or 107 {CFU}, and concomitant treatment with standard-of-care gemcitabine during the priming phase, and any treatment thereafter, was allowed in the study. Immunomonitoring involved interferon-gamma ({IFNγ}) {ELIspot} analysis with long overlapping peptides spanning the entire {VEGFR}2 sequence. A total of 26 patients were treated. Treatment-related adverse events preferentially associated with {VXM}01 were decreases in lymphocyte numbers in the blood, increased frequencies of neutrophils and diarrhea. Eight out of 16 patients who received at least one boosting vaccination responded with pronounced, i.e. at least 3-fold, increase in {VEGFR}2-specific T cell response over baseline levels. In the {VXM}01 vaccination group, {VEGFR}2-specific T cells peaked preferentially during the boosting phase with an average 4-fold increase over baseline levels. In conclusion, prime/boost vaccination with {VXM}01 was safe and immunogenic and increased vaccine specific T cell responses compared with placebo treatment.},

We here studied the safety, tolerability, T effector (Teff), T regulatory (Treg) and humoral responses to {VEGFR}2 and anti-angiogenic effects in advanced pancreatic cancer patients in a randomized, dose escalation phase I clinical trial. Results of the first 3 mo observation period are reported. Locally advanced or metastatic, pancreatic cancer patients were enrolled. In five escalating dose groups, 30 patients received {VXM}01 and 15 placebo on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Treatment was well tolerated at all dose levels. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Salmonella excretion and salmonella-specific humoral immune responses occurred in the two highest dose groups. {VEGFR}2 specific Teff, but not Treg responses were overall increased in vaccinated patients. We furthermore observed a significant reduction of tumor perfusion after 38 d in vaccinated patients together with increased levels of serum biomarkers indicative of anti-angiogenic activity, {VEGF}-A, and collagen {IV}. Vaccine specific Teff responses significantly correlated with reductions of tumor perfusion and high levels of preexisting {VEGFR}2-specific Teff while those showing no antiangiogenic activity had low levels of preexisting {VEGFR}2 specific Teff, showed a transient early increase of {VEGFR}2-specific Treg and reduced levels of {VEGFR}2-specific Teff at later time points - pointing to the possibility that early anti-angiogenic activity might be based at least in part on specific reactivation of preexisting memory T cells.},

The immune reaction elicited by {VXM}01 is expected to disrupt the tumor neovasculature and, consequently, inhibit tumor growth. {VXM}01 potentially combines the advantages of anti-angiogenic therapy and active immunotherapy. {METHODS}/{DESIGN}: This phase I trial examines the safety, tolerability, and immunological and clinical responses to {VXM}01. The randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind dose-escalation study includes up to 45 patients with locally advanced and stage {IV} pancreatic cancer. The patients will receive four doses of {VXM}01 or placebo in addition to gemcitabine as standard of care. Doses from 106 cfu up to 1010 cfu of {VXM}01 will be evaluated in the study. An independent data safety monitoring board ({DSMB}) will be involved in the dose-escalation decisions. In addition to safety as primary endpoint, the {VXM}01-specific immune reaction, as well as clinical response parameters will be evaluated. {DISCUSSION}: The results of this study shall provide the first data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the oral anti-{VEGFR}-2 vaccine {VXM}01 in cancer patients. They will also define the recommended dose for phase {II} and provide the basis for further clinical evaluation, which may also include additional cancer indications. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {EudraCT} No.: 2011-000222-29, {NCT}01486329, {ISRCTN}68809279.},

	abstract = {Abstract A carcinoembryonic Ag ({CEA})-based {DNA} vaccine encoding both {CEA} and {CD}40 ligand trimer achieved effective tumor-protective immunity against murine colon carcinoma in {CEA}-transgenic mice by activating both naive T cells and dendritic cells. Peripheral T cell tolerance to {CEA} was broken in a prophylactic model by this novel, dual-function {DNA} vaccine, whose efficacy was further enhanced by boosts with a recombinant Ab-{IL}-2 fusion protein ({huKS}1/4-{IL}-2). These conclusions are supported by four lines of evidence. First, a lethal challenge of {MC}38-{CEA}-{KS} Ag murine colon carcinoma cells was for the first time completely rejected in 100\% of experimental animals treated by oral gavage of this {DNA} vaccine carried by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium, followed by five boosts with {huKS}1/4-{IL}-2. Second, specific activation of dendritic cells was indicated by their marked up-regulation in expression of costimulatory molecules B7.1 ({CD}80), B7.2 ({CD}86), and {ICAM}-1. Third, a decisive increase over control values was observed in both {MHC} class I Ag-restricted cytotoxicity of {CTLs} from successfully vaccinated mice and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines {IFN}-γ and {IL}-12. Fourth, activation of {CTLs} was augmented, as indicated by up-regulation of activity markers {LFA}-1, {CD}25, {CD}28, and {CD}69. Taken together, these results suggest that a dual-function {DNA} vaccine encoding {CEA} and {CD}40 ligand trimer combined with tumor-targeted {IL}-2 may be a promising strategy for the rational development of {DNA}-based cancer vaccines for future clinical applications.},
