Its key advantages are:\n\nRobust T-cell response – It has been shown to generate strong T-cell responses against many different antigens in both animals and humans.\nContinuous dosing – The low therapeutic doses required are suitable for continuous prime and boost administrations without raising anti-carrier immunity, adding a significant safety margin.\nPlatform versatility – The platform is suitable for addressing multiple targets with a single treatment and can be easily combined with other immunotherapies.\nRapid & efficient – Our approach features high modularity (‘plug and play’ capability), a low-cost and robust production process, and rapid development timelines from concept to the clinical stage."

    "text": "VAXIMM’s pipeline is built on our versatile oral T-cell immunotherapy platform designed to combat cancer through multiple mechanisms.\nOur lead candidate, VXM01, is an oral immunotherapy that activates T-cells against VEGFR2, a key protein in tumor vasculature. This process destroys the tumor’s blood supply and increases the infiltration of immune cells, with broad anti-tumor activity observed in preclinical and clinical studies.\nBuilding on this validated approach, we are advancing a portfolio of preclinical assets targeting other critical cancer pathways. Together, these programs represent a deep and diversified strategy to address unmet needs in oncology.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I/II trial evaluating VXM01 in combination with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of glioblastoma has been completed. The trial is part of a collaboration agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer Inc.\nVXM01 has received orphan designation from the European Commission and from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of glioblastoma.\nLearn more about the study (NCT03750071) here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I pilot study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VXM01, as well as clinical and immunogenic response, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.\nFourteen patients were treated with VXM01, including three who were also treated with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab. Of the fourteen patients treated, one patient experienced an objective response with VXM01 monotherapy and a durable response with the addition of nivolumab. During the observation period of up to 20 months, seven patients were still alive, all of them living for more than one year.\nLearn more about the study (NCT02718443) here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I trial in advanced pancreatic cancer showed that VXM01 was well tolerated and led to the activation of VEGFR2-specific cytotoxic T-cells, which was associated with significantly improved patient survival.\nThe data have been published (Niethammer et al. 2012; Schmitz-Winnenthal et al. 2015, 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNiethammer, Andreas G., Heinz Lubenau, Gerd Mikus, Philipp Knebel, Nicolas Hohmann, Christine Leowardi, Philipp Beckhove, et al. 2012. “Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled First in Human Study to Investigate an Oral Vaccine Aimed to Elicit an Immune Reaction Against the VEGF-Receptor 2 in Patients with Stage IV and Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.” BMC Cancer 12 (August): 361. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-12-361.\n\n\nSchmitz-Winnenthal, Friedrich H., Nicolas Hohmann, Andreas G.

This process destroys the tumor’s blood supply and increases the infiltration of immune cells, with broad anti-tumor activity observed in preclinical and clinical studies.\nBuilding on this validated approach, we are advancing a portfolio of preclinical assets targeting other critical cancer pathways. Together, these programs represent a deep and diversified strategy to address unmet needs in oncology.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I/II trial evaluating VXM01 in combination with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of glioblastoma has been completed. The trial is part of a collaboration agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer Inc.\nVXM01 has received orphan designation from the European Commission and from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of glioblastoma.\nLearn more about the study (NCT03750071) here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I pilot study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VXM01, as well as clinical and immunogenic response, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.\nFourteen patients were treated with VXM01, including three who were also treated with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab. Of the fourteen patients treated, one patient experienced an objective response with VXM01 monotherapy and a durable response with the addition of nivolumab. During the observation period of up to 20 months, seven patients were still alive, all of them living for more than one year.\nLearn more about the study (NCT02718443) here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I trial in advanced pancreatic cancer showed that VXM01 was well tolerated and led to the activation of VEGFR2-specific cytotoxic T-cells, which was associated with significantly improved patient survival.\nThe data have been published (Niethammer et al. 2012; Schmitz-Winnenthal et al. 2015, 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNiethammer, Andreas G., Heinz Lubenau, Gerd Mikus, Philipp Knebel, Nicolas Hohmann, Christine Leowardi, Philipp Beckhove, et al. 2012. “Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled First in Human Study to Investigate an Oral Vaccine Aimed to Elicit an Immune Reaction Against the VEGF-Receptor 2 in Patients with Stage IV and Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.” BMC Cancer 12 (August): 361. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-12-361.\n\n\nSchmitz-Winnenthal, Friedrich H., Nicolas Hohmann, Andreas G.
