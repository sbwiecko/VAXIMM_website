This strain has been proven to be very safe and well tolerated. All immunotherapies resulting from this platform are taken orally by the patient (Andreas G. Niethammer et al. 2001; Andreas G.

    "text": "Unique Mechanism of Action\nAfter oral ingestion, the modified Ty21a bacteria, which contain the cDNA of the desired cancer target(s), pass the stomach and invade the patient’s Peyer’s patches located in the small intestine. Uptake of the bacteria in macrophages, the eating cells present in these lymphoid tissues, leads to strong expression of and subsequently to a specific cellular immune response towards the encoded cancer antigen(s). These so-called “killer” T-cells then destroy the respective antigen expressing tumor or tumor stroma cells.\n\n\n\nVAXIMM oral T-cell immunotherapy"

    "text": "Key Platform Advantages\nThe oral bacterial technology enables delivery to the most immunocompetent organ of the body, targeting the lymphatic tissue of the gut, and has been shown to generate robust T-cell responses against many different antigens in animals and humans in first clinical studies.\nThe low therapeutic doses required for specific T-cell activation make this approach suitable for continuous dosing (prime and boost administrations), without raising anti-carrier immunity, and provide another safety margin for carrier-related toxicity.\nThe platform is suitable for addressing multiple targets with one treatment and can be combined with additional immune therapies. Another major advantage of this approach is the high modularity (plug and play), the low cost and robustness of the production process, and the rapid development timelines taking products from concept to clinical stage.\nThis oral bacterial technology enables several key advantages:\n\nRobust T-cell response: has been shown to generate strong T-cell responses against many different antigens in both animals and humans.\nContinuous dosing: the low therapeutic doses required are suitable for continuous prime and boost administrations without raising anti-carrier immunity, adding a significant safety margin.\nPlatform versatility: the platform is suitable for addressing multiple targets with a single treatment and can be easily combined with other immunotherapies.\nRapid & efficient: the approach features high modularity (‘plug and play’ capability), a low-cost and robust production process, and rapid development timelines from concept to the clinical stage."

This appoach significantly reduces the possibility of resistance development, and may be advantageous in the full suppression of the neoangiogenesis mechanism.\nPrior to initiating clinical development, VXM01 showed significant anti-VEGFR-2, anti-neoangiogenesis and anti-tumour activity in a number of preclinical models.
