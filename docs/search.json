This would eliminate the need for both the bullet point descriptions that are repeating the titles in the graphic already and simplify this technology page)\n\nOral Administration & Gastric Transit – The genetically modified Ty21a vector is administered orally.\nTargeting of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) – The eukaryotic vector targets the Peyer’s patches in the small intestine, where specialized cells transport it into the body’s underlying immune tissue.\nAntigen Processing and Presentation – “In the gut’s immune tissue, the vector is absorbed by Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). Inside, It releases a genetic payload that drives these cells to manufacture and present the specific target.\nT-Cell Priming and Activation – This initiates an adaptive immune response, leading to the robust activation and clonal expansion of both antigen-specific CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4⁺ helper T-cells.\nSystemic Effector Response – The activated T-cells then enter systemic circulation, where they traffic throughout the body to locate and eliminate any malignant cells presenting the specific target antigen."

    "text": "VAXIMM’s pipeline is built on our versatile oral T-cell immunotherapy platform designed to combat cancer through multiple mechanisms.\nOur lead clinical candidate, VXM01, is an oral immunotherapy that activates T-cells against VEGFR2, a key validated protein in the tumor vasculature. By activating this process with VXM01, tumor blood supply is abolished while enabling infiltration of immune cells with broad anti-tumor effects.\nBuilding on this validated approach, we are advancing a pipeline programs targeting other critical and validated cancer pathways. Together, these programs represent a deep and diversified strategy to address unmet needs in oncology.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I/II trial evaluating VXM01 in combination with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of glioblastoma has been completed.

Of the fourteen patients treated, one patient experienced an objective response with VXM01 monotherapy and a durable response with the addition of nivolumab.
