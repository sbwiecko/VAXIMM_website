    "text": "Unique Mechanism of Action\nThe platform leverages the gut’s powerful immune system through a unique process:\n\nOral Administration & Gastric Transit – The genetically modified Ty21a vector is administered orally.\nTargeting of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) – The bacterial vector targets the Peyer’s patches in the small intestine, where specialized cells transport it into the body’s underlying immune tissue.\nAntigen Processing and Presentation – “In the gut’s immune tissue, the vector is absorbed by Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). Inside, It releases a genetic payload that drives these cells to manufacture and present the specific target.\nT-Cell Priming and Activation – This initiates an adaptive immune response, leading to the robust activation and clonal expansion of both antigen-specific CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4⁺ helper T-cells.\nSystemic Effector Response – The activated T-cells then enter systemic circulation, where they traffic throughout the body to locate and eliminate any malignant cells presenting the specific target antigen."

Its key advantages are:\n\nRobust T-cell response – It has been shown to generate strong T-cell responses against many different antigens in both animals and humans.\nContinuous dosing – The low therapeutic doses required are suitable for continuous prime and boost administrations without raising anti-carrier immunity, adding a significant safety margin.\nPlatform versatility – The platform is suitable for addressing multiple targets with a single treatment and can be easily combined with other immunotherapies.\nRapid & efficient – Our approach features high modularity (‘plug and play’ capability), a low-cost and robust production process, and rapid development timelines from concept to the clinical stage."

These include: VXM04, targeting Mesothelin; VXM06 targeting Wilms tumor suppressor gene 1 (WT1); VXM08, targeting the tumor-associated antigen CEA; and VXM10, targeting the immune checkpoint PD-L1. Together, these programs represent a deep and diversified strategy to address unmet needs in oncology.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Phase I/II trial evaluating VXM01 in combination with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of glioblastoma has been completed.
