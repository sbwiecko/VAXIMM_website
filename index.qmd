## Empowering patient's immune response

VAXIMM is pioneering **first-in-class oral immunotherapies** using a live attenuated bacterial platform (Ty21a) with a decades-long record of safety.

Our technology efficiently delivers antigens to the gut's immune system, providing a powerful and convenient method for generating **robust T cell responses**. The platform's **high modularity and low production cost** enable rapid development timelines. Our mission is to engineer safe and potent oral immunotherapies that activate the immune system to identify and destroy malignant cells.

**Clinical and pre-clinical data** confirm our platform's ability to induce strong, specific T-cell activation with excellent tolerability, making it suitable for continuous dosing and combination therapies.

## Oral Delivery & Unique Mode of Action

After oral ingestion, our modified Ty21a bacteria, which contain the genetic code for desired cancer targets, pass the stomach and invade the patient's Peyer's patches in the small intestine. This delivery method targets the lymphatic tissue of the gut, the most immunocompetent organ in the body.

:::

Once inside these lymphoid tissues, the bacteria are taken up by macrophages, leading to the strong expression of the cancer antigen and subsequently a specific and powerful cellular immune response. This process generates CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that are primed to seek out and destroy cells expressing the target antigen.

## Pipeline

Our lead clinical candidate, **VXM01**, is an oral T-cell immunotherapy that has been evaluated in multiple oncology indications. The clinical program for VXM01 includes a Phase I trial in **pancreatic cancer**, a Phase I trial in **glioblastoma**, and a Phase I/II combination trial with the checkpoint inhibitor avelumab in **glioblastoma**.
