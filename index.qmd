## A Paradigm Shift in Immunotherapy 

The VAXIMM T-cell immunotherapy platform is engineered to deliver strong and specific efficacy with an exceptional safety profile, targeting a vast array of validated and novel drug targets in oncology, infectious diseases, and beyond.

Our approach combines the convenience of oral administration with the power of a targeted T-cell response, creating a therapy with clear advantages for patients and healthcare systems:

- **Potent and Lasting Efficacy** -- Our technology is inherently self-adjuvanting, generating robust and highly specific T-cell responses designed for the durable elimination of target cells. By harnessing the patient's own immune system, we create a long-lasting therapeutic effect with a low risk of resistance development.
- **Outstanding Safety and Precision** -- Clinical data from multiple Phase I and II studies, including in fragile cancer patient populations, have demonstrated that VAXIMM therapies are exceptionally well-tolerated. The T-cell-based mechanism ensures minimal to no collateral damage to healthy tissue.
- **Unprecedented Patient Convenience** -- An oral formulation replaces complex infusions, dramatically improving patient compliance and quality of life while reducing treatment-associated costs for the healthcare system.

## Pipeline

**VXM01**, our Phase II clinical candidate, is engineered to elicit a specific T-cell immune response against VEGFR-2, a growth factor receptor important for the formation of new blood vessels, and for the formation of tumor-supporting neovasculature. Unlike other approaches to VEGF/VEGFR inhibition, the VXM01 mechanism of action is based entirely on harnessing the immune system against the target, and destroys cells expressing the target receptor. This appoach significantly reduces the possibility of resistance development, and may be advantageous in the full suppression of the neoangiogenesis mechanism.

Prior to initiating clinical development, VXM01 showed significant anti-VEGFR-2, anti-neoangiogenesis and anti-tumour activity in a number of preclinical models. VXM01 has completed a Phase I/II combination trial in advanced **glioblastoma (GBM)** in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor, and was previously evaluated in Phase I studies in **pancreatic cancer and GBM**.
