## Our history

The foundational technology of VAXIMM was developed by Dr. Andreas Niethammer during his tenure at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) in La Jolla. As the inventor of the oral T-cell immunotherapy platform, Dr. Niethammer's vision was to create a safe, convenient, and potent treatment to fight cancer. Today, as VAXIMM's Chief Medical Officer, he continues to lead the company's clinical development, guiding his innovative research from the laboratory to patients in need.

### From Academic Innovation to a Clinical-Stage Oral Immunotherapy Platform

VAXIMM was founded to advance this novel platform, which is based on a live, attenuated, and safe oral bacterial vaccine strain. This vector is uniquely modified to stimulate a patient's own cytotoxic T-cells to target specific structures within tumors.

Our lead product candidate, **VXM01**, activates killer T-cells that target the tumor's specific vasculature, thereby increasing immune cell infiltration in solid tumors. The program has been successfully evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including for challenging indications like brain cancer. VAXIMM's progress is validated by key scientific and corporate collaborations, including a completed clinical trial of VXM01 with the checkpoint inhibitor avelumab in partnership with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and a major licensing agreement with China Medical System Holdings (CMS) for development and commercialization rights in Asia.

In November 2022, VAXIMM was acquired by BCM Europe AG, becoming a key part of the **OSR Holdings AG group**. This strategic acquisition is accelerating the development of our promising pipeline, building on a decade of scientific excellence to deliver next-generation oral immunotherapies to patients.
