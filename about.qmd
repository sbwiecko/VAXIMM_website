Our foundational technology, an oral T-cell immunotherapy platform, was developed at UC San Diego by Dr. Andreas Niethammer [@niethammer_dna_2002]. His vision was to create a safe, convenient, and effective cancer therapy. Today, as VAXIMM's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Niethammer continues to guide this innovative research from the laboratory to patients in need.

## From Academic Innovation to a Clinical-Stage Oral Immunotherapy Platform

VAXIMM is advancing a novel immunotherapy platform based on a safe, oral bacterial vaccine strain. This vector is modified to stimulate a patient's own T-cells to target tumors. Our lead candidate, VXM01, targets tumor vasculature and has shown success in multiple clinical trials, including for brain cancer.

Validated by a clinical collaboration with Merck KGaA and a major licensing agreement with China Medical System (CMS), VAXIMM was acquired by BCM Europe AG in 2022. As a key subsidiary of **OSR Holdings, Inc.** (NASDAQ:OSRH), we are accelerating our pipeline to deliver the next generation of oral immunotherapies to patients.
