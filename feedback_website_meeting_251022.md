# Feedback meeting, 22 October 2025

The purpose of this meeting is to review the website's content (Is the information correct? Is anything missing?) and function (Does this button make sense? Is the user flow logical?).

We are NOT discussing visual design, colors, or fonts. That's what we're hiring the professional for. We're focusing on the skeleton and the message.

## Technology

Page title: Platform Technology Enabling First-in-Class Oral Immunotherapies

“Eukaryotic vector” instead of “bacteria”

Validated Technology Platform\VAXIMM’s core technology uses a genetically modified eukaryotic vector as a carrier of unique genetic sequences designed to specifically target key antigens to activate the host immune system.

This engineered eukaryotic vector (Ty21a), originally known as Vivotif™, serves as a highly effective delivery vector with an extensive safety profile as an approved oral vaccine against typhoid fever.

Directed delivery via gut lymphatic tissue allows for strong and persistent T-cell responses with a demonstrable low-dose and safe profile suitable for continuous repeat administration. This novel technology platform is specific yet versatile, with the potential to target multiple conditions with a single oral vector. In addition, combination treatment regimens have been clinically assessed with several immunotherapies. Several key advantages of this technology platform are highlighted:

* Robust T-cell response demonstrated against many different antigens in both pre-clinical animal models and in humans
* Safe low therapeutic doses allow for continuous dosing regimens suitable for continuous prime and boost administrations without raising anti-carrier immunity and adding a significant safety margin
* Platform versatility enables addressing multiple targets with a single treatment and can be easily combined with other immunotherapies
* Rapid & efficient platform offers high modularity (‘plug and play’) capability, low-cost and robust production process, and rapid development timelines from concept to the clinical stage

Unique mechanism of action

Leveraging the gut’s powerful innate immune system-drivenprocess

1. Oral Administration & Gastric Transit – The genetically modified Ty21a vector is administered orally.
2. Targeting of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) – The eukaryotic vector targets the Peyer’s patches in the small intestine, where specialized cells transport it into the body’s underlying immune tissue.
3. Antigen Processing and Presentation – “In the gut’s immune tissue, the vector is absorbed by Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). Inside, It releases a genetic payload that drives these cells to manufacture and present the specific target.
4. T-Cell Priming and Activation – This initiates an adaptive immune response, leading to the robust activation and clonal expansion of both antigen-specific CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4⁺ helper T-cells.
5. Systemic Effector Response – The activated T-cells then enter systemic circulation, where they traffic throughout the body to locate and eliminate any malignant cells presenting the specific target antigen.

## Pipeline

Advancing Novel Immunotherapies for Indications with High Unmet Needs

VAXIMM’s pipeline is built on our versatile oral T-cell immunotherapy platform designed to combat cancer through multiple mechanisms.

Our lead clinical candidate, VXM01, is an oral immunotherapy that activates T-cells against VEGFR2, a key validated protein in the tumor vasculature. By activating this process with VXM01, tumor blood supply is abolished while enabling infiltration of immune cells with broad anti-tumor effects.

Building on this validated approach, we are advancing a pipeline programs targeting other critical and validated cancer pathways. Together, these programs represent a deep and diversified strategy to address unmet needs in oncology.
