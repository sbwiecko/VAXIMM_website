VAXIMM's technology is a first-in-class oral T-cell immunotherapy platform. It uses a live, attenuated bacterial strain, Ty21a, which is genetically modified using a plasmid to carry the genetic code (cDNA) for specific target antigens, such as those found on cancer cells. This engineered strain, originally known as Vivotif™, serves as a highly effective delivery vector and has an extensive safety record from its use as an oral vaccine against typhoid fever in millions of people.

## Unique Mechanism of Action

The platform leverages the gut's powerful immune system through a unique process:

1. **Oral Administration & Gastric Transit** -- The genetically modified Ty21a vector is administered orally.
2. **Targeting of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)** -- Upon reaching the small intestine, the bacterial vector specifically targets the Peyer's patches. It is actively transported across the intestinal epithelial barrier by specialized microfold cells (M cells) into the underlying lymphoid tissue.
3. **Antigen Processing and Presentation** -- Within the Peyer's patches, the vector is phagocytosed by professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The bacterium lyses within the APC, releasing the plasmid containing the gene for the target antigen. The APC's cellular machinery transcribes and translates this gene, processing the resulting protein into peptide fragments which are then presented on its surface via both MHC Class I and Class II molecules.
4. **T-Cell Priming and Activation** -- The presentation of these antigenic peptides to naïve T-cells initiates an adaptive immune response. This leads to the robust activation and clonal expansion of both antigen-specific CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and CD4⁺ helper T-cells.
5. **Systemic Effector Response** -- The activated, antigen-specific T-cells exit the GALT and enter systemic circulation. These effector T-cells traffic throughout the body to locate and eliminate target cells (e.g., tumor cells) that are presenting the specific antigen, inducing cell death primarily through apoptotic pathways.

## Key Platform Advantages

Our oral bacterial technology delivers treatment to the gut's lymphatic tissue, generating strong T-cell responses with low, safe doses suitable for continuous administration. The platform is versatile, allowing for the targeting of multiple conditions with a single treatment, and can be combined with other immunotherapies. Its key advantages are:

* **Robust T-cell response** -- It has been shown to generate strong T-cell responses against many different antigens in both animals and humans.
* **Continuous dosing** -- The low therapeutic doses required are suitable for continuous prime and boost administrations without raising anti-carrier immunity, adding a significant safety margin.
* **Platform versatility** -- The platform is suitable for addressing multiple targets with a single treatment and can be easily combined with other immunotherapies.
* **Rapid & efficient** -- Our approach features high modularity ('plug and play' capability), a low-cost and robust production process, and rapid development timelines from concept to the clinical stage.

## The competitive edge

We combine the best attributes of modern vaccine technologies while mitigating their key weaknesses. This chart compares our platform against major alternatives across critical therapeutic and logistical features.
