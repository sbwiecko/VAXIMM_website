## Unique Mechanism of Action

The platform leverages the gut's powerful immune system through a unique process:

1. **Oral Administration & Gastric Transit** -- The genetically modified Ty21a vector is administered orally.
2. **Targeting of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)** -- The eukaryotic vector targets the Peyer's patches in the small intestine, where specialized cells transport it into the body's underlying immune tissue.
3. **Antigen Processing and Presentation** -- "In the gut's immune tissue, the vector is absorbed by Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). Inside, It releases a genetic payload that drives these cells to manufacture and present the specific target.
4. **T-Cell Priming and Activation** -- This initiates an adaptive immune response, leading to the robust activation and clonal expansion of both antigen-specific CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4⁺ helper T-cells.
5. **Systemic Effector Response** -- The activated T-cells then enter systemic circulation, where they traffic throughout the body to locate and eliminate any malignant cells presenting the specific target antigen.

## A Proven Platform for Safe, Oral Immunotherapy

VAXIMM's technology uses an eukaryotic vector, which is genetically modified using a plasmid to carry the genetic code (cDNA) for specific target antigens, such as those found on cancer cells.

This engineered strain, originally known as Vivotif™, serves as a highly effective delivery vector and has an extensive safety record from its use as an oral vaccine against typhoid fever in millions of people.

## Key Platform Advantages

Our oral technology delivers treatment to the gut's lymphatic tissue, generating strong T-cell responses with low, safe doses suitable for continuous administration.

The platform is versatile, allowing for the targeting of multiple conditions with a single treatment, and can be combined with other immunotherapies. Its key advantages are:

* **Robust T-cell response** -- It has been shown to generate strong T-cell responses against many different antigens in both animals and humans.
* **Continuous dosing** -- The low therapeutic doses required are suitable for continuous prime and boost administrations without raising anti-carrier immunity, adding a significant safety margin.
* **Platform versatility** -- The platform is suitable for addressing multiple targets with a single treatment and can be easily combined with other immunotherapies.
* **Rapid & efficient** -- Our approach features high modularity ('plug and play' capability), a low-cost and robust production process, and rapid development timelines from concept to the clinical stage.
