## Advancing Novel Immunotherapy from Preclinical to Clinical Development

VAXIMM's pipeline is built on our versatile oral T-cell immunotherapy platform designed to combat cancer through multiple mechanisms.

Our lead candidate, **VXM01**, is an oral immunotherapy that activates T-cells against VEGFR2, a key protein in tumor vasculature. This process destroys the tumor's blood supply and increases the infiltration of immune cells, with broad anti-tumor activity observed in preclinical and clinical studies.

Building on this validated approach, we are advancing a portfolio of preclinical assets targeting other critical cancer pathways. These include: **VXM04**, targeting Mesothelin; **VXM06** targeting Wilms tumor suppressor gene 1 (WT1); **VXM08**, targeting the tumor-associated antigen CEA; and **VXM10**, targeting the immune checkpoint PD-L1. Together, these programs represent a deep and diversified strategy to address unmet needs in oncology.

A Phase I/II trial evaluating VXM01 in combination with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of glioblastoma has been completed. The trial is part of a collaboration agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer Inc.

VXM01 has received orphan designation from the European Commission and from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of glioblastoma.

A Phase I pilot study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VXM01, as well as clinical and immunogenic response, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

Fourteen patients were treated with VXM01, including three who were also treated with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab. Of the fourteen patients treated, one patient experienced an objective response with VXM01 monotherapy and a durable response with the addition of nivolumab. During the observation period of up to 20 months, seven patients were still alive, all of them living for more than one year.

A Phase I trial in advanced pancreatic cancer showed that VXM01 was well tolerated and led to the activation of VEGFR2-specific cytotoxic T-cells, which was associated with significantly improved patient survival.

The data have been published [@niethammer_double-blind_2012; @schmitz-winnenthal_anti-angiogenic_2015; @schmitz-winnenthal_phase_2018].

VXM04 is a T-cell immunotherapy targeting mesothelin. Mesothelin is a protein that is overexpressed in several solid tumors, including mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In preclinical studies, VXM04 has shown potent peripheral CD8+ T-cell activation against mesothelin and stand-alone therapeutic activity in a syngeneic models of pancreatic cancer.

VXM06 is a T-cell immunotherapy targeting Wilms Tumor Protein (WT1). WT1 is overexpressed in several hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including acute leukemias, glioblastoma, colon cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and ovarian cancer. In preclinical studies, VXM06 has shown strong T-cell activation against WT1 and stand-alone therapeutic activity in a disseminated model of leukemia. In a GLP toxicology study, VXM06 was generally well tolerated following repeat oral administration for 13 weeks.

VXM10 is a T-cell immunotherapy targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 is an immunomodulatory antigen ligand that acts as an immune checkpoint and is frequently upregulated on the surface of cancer cells in many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. When PD-L1 binds to its receptor, PD-1, on the surface of activated T-cells, it delivers an inhibitory signal that prevents the T-cells from attacking and destroying cancer cells. VXM10 has shown stand-alone therapeutic activity in a disseminated preclinical model of leukemia.
